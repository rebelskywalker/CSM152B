This is my partner and my ALU Design project. 

We took the ahrder route which I believe every team opted out of during digital design and that was to use pure gates and
implement foundational structural design from each bit level to generating a full ALU. At some point the TA allowed
for conditional logic for teams in the shift design, however there was a question in our report about how you would extend
that if you purely did gatees only.
